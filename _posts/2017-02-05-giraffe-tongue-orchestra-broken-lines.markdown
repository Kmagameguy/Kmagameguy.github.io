On first listen, there seems to be a lot of ego on display.  The tracks are cohesive as an album, but individually there's only fragments that shine.  The rest sounds "noisy", like they're still trying feel each other out.  Can't wait to hear what their sophomore follow-up might sound like once they've had some time to play to each others' strengths.
